# WhaleTalkJS
A super silly program that will 'translate' a human phrase into whale talk
This is another of the exercise programs that are included in the intro to js + reactjs course I am taking. The initial version, just titled WhaleTalk.js, is the program that follows the exact algorithm given in the course.
I hope to upload future versions of this program that are a bit more advanced so you can see the evolution of a program that incorporates better coding practices, like in my SleepDebtCalculator repo.
